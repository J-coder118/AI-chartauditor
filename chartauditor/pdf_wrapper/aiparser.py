samReport = """# 65D-30 Audit Report  
 You are an expert auditor specializing in Substance Abuse, Substance Use, and Mental Health regulations in Florida. Your task is to evaluate a patient chart's compliance with specific regulations from 65D-30.

For each question asked about a specific 65D-30 regulation (e.g., "Based on the 65D-30.[specific regulation number]), provide a structured response using the following format:

## Regulatory Adherence to 65D-30.[specific regulation number]

- Examine the patient chart for compliance with 65D-30.[specific regulation number].
- Identify any discrepancies, lapses, or deviations from this regulation. Provide specific instances from the chart where these occur, referencing page numbers when possible.
- Offer detailed advice on how to address these issues to ensure the chart meets the requirements of this regulation.

## Recommendations
What they need to do to correct it to meet 65D-30.[specific regulation number]
## Score

- Assign a numeric score between 0-100 for the chart's compliance with 65D-30.[specific regulation number], where 0 indicates complete non-compliance and 100 indicates perfect compliance.

Please provide your response in nicely formatted markdown, with a minimum of 500 characters. If you are unsure about any findings, do not make anything up; simply provide factual output based on the information available in the provided documents.

Your responses will eventually be compiled into a larger report evaluating the patient chart's overall compliance with relevant 65D-30 regulations. Focus on providing a thorough, regulation-specific evaluation for each question asked.

## Regulatory Adherence to 65D-30.0043 Placement  
- Review of the patient chart reveals the following issues with 65D-30.0043 Placement standards:  
  - No documentation of criteria and procedures for admitting, retaining, transferring and discharging individuals.    
  - No indication that the individual was assessed prior to admission to determine level of service need and choice.  
  - No referral to a proper level of care when the assessed level was not available.  
  - A primary counselor is not assigned to the individual.  
  - Orientation does not cover all required components (description of services, rights, admission/discharge policies, fees, rules, grievance process, confidentiality, advance directives).  
  - No physician documentation that individual is not being retained in a service beyond the provider's capability to meet their needs.  
  - Discharge/transfer summary with required elements is missing.  
  
- To rectify these problems and comply with 65D-30.0043, the provider should:  
  - Develop written criteria and procedures for admissions, retention, transfer and discharge.   
  - Ensure individuals are assessed pre-admission for appropriate level of care and referred out if that level is not available.    
  - Assign a primary counselor to each individual and document this in their chart.  
  - Provide a comprehensive orientation and document this, including all required topics per 65D-30.0043.  
  - Involve the physician in determinations and documentation around ability to meet individual's service needs.   
  - Provide individuals with a discharge/transfer summary that contains all elements required by 65D-30.0043.  
  - Implement a quality assurance process to audit records for these placement standards.  
  
### Score  
Based on the lack of evidence of compliance with most placement standards, this patient chart earns a 30 out of 100 for meeting 65D-30.0043 requirements.
